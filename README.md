🚀 HFV Seed Sale DApp

Welcome to the official HFV Seed Sale decentralized application. This DApp allows users to buy HFV tokens during the seed round, track their allocation, and claim vested tokens over a 6-month schedule.





📈 Token Vesting Explained (for Seed Sale Buyers)

When you purchase HFV tokens through the Seed Sale, your tokens are not delivered all at once. Instead, they are vested over a 6-month period, starting from the moment of purchase.

⏳ Vesting Schedule:

Total vesting period: 6 months (180 days)

Cliff: None – vesting starts immediately upon purchase

Distribution: Linear daily release

Each day, a fixed portion of your purchased HFV becomes claimable.



🧮 Daily Claim Calculation:

Example: You purchased 1,800 HFV tokens.

You’ll unlock:

1,800 HFV / 180 days = 10 HFV per day

You can claim each day or in batches — unclaimed tokens accumulate.


📊 Visual Chart Example:

Day | Claimable HFV
-----|----------------
  1 | 10
  5 | 50
 30 | 300
 90 | 900
180 | 1800 (Fully vested)

📤 How to Claim

Use the "Claim HFV" section in the DApp. After connecting your wallet:

You will see:

Allocated: Total purchased tokens

Claimed: Amount already claimed

Claimable: Amount currently available


Click "Claim Now" to receive unlocked tokens directly to your wallet.


💡 Key Notes

The smart contract enforces the vesting logic — no early access is possible.

If you don’t claim daily, unclaimed HFV rolls over and stays available.
